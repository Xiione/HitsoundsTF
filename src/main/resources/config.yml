## HITSOUNDS CONFIG ##

# What amount of damage should be considered to be the absolute
# minimum (or close to minimum) amount of damage that can be dealt in an attack?
# (2.0 points of damage = one heart)
# This value is used to calculate hitsound pitch.
# This should generally be much lower than high-damage. Adjust it to fit the gamemode.
# NOTE: Requires restart
low-damage: 1.0

# What amount of damage should be considered to be the absolute
# maximum (or close to maximum) amount of damage that can be dealt in an attack?

# This should generally be much greater than low-damage. Adjust it to fit the gamemode.
# NOTE: Requires restart
